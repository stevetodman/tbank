Additional risk factors include chronic hypoxemia causing cerebral hypoperfusion and microinfarcts (providing nidus for infection), polycythemia with hyperviscosity leading to thrombosis and infarction, and relative immunocompromise. Brain abscesses in CHD patients are typically caused by Streptococcus species (viridans group), Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.
