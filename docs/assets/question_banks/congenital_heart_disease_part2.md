## Question 9: Patent Ductus Arteriosus - Pharmacologic Closure

- **Subject:** Pharmacology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Patent Ductus Arteriosus (Pharmacologic Management)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

An 8-day-old premature boy on mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome has a continuous murmur at the left infraclavicular region with bounding pulses and widened pulse pressure. Echocardiography demonstrates a persistent vascular connection between the descending aorta and the pulmonary artery. To promote closure of this connection, the neonate receives a medication that reduces prostaglandin E₂ synthesis.

**Question**

Which of the following best describes the drug's mechanism of action?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2)
- ⬜ **B.** Competitive inhibition of prostaglandin E synthase
- ⬜ **C.** Inhibition of phospholipase A₂
- ⬜ **D.** Antagonism of prostaglandin E (EP) receptors on ductal smooth muscle
- ⬜ **E.** Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase
- ⬜ **F.** Blockade of endothelin-1 receptors

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

The ductus arteriosus normally closes within the first 2 days after birth as rising oxygen tension and declining placental prostaglandin E₂ trigger constriction of ductal smooth muscle. Premature infants often have elevated PGE₂ levels or increased sensitivity to prostaglandins, leading to persistent patency (PDA). NSAIDs such as indomethacin or ibuprofen inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), the enzyme converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H₂, thereby decreasing downstream PGE₂ production. Loss of PGE₂'s vasodilatory effect causes functional and then anatomic ductal closure.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** PGE synthase inhibition would theoretically lower PGE₂, but no neonatal drug acts at this step.
- **C.** Phospholipase A₂ inhibition by corticosteroids blocks all downstream eicosanoids and is not used for PDA closure.
- **D.** EP-receptor antagonism would oppose PGE₂ signaling directly, but no approved neonatal agent works here.
- **E.** Nitric oxide synthase inhibition causes systemic vasoconstriction without targeting the ductus.
- **F.** Endothelin-1 receptor blockade (eg, bosentan) treats pulmonary hypertension, not PDA.

**Rapid review**

- Indomethacin/ibuprofen → COX inhibition → ↓ PGE₂ → ductal smooth muscle contraction.
- Monitor for adverse effects such as reduced renal perfusion or necrotizing enterocolitis.
- Use prostaglandin E₁ to keep the ductus open in ductal-dependent lesions.

## Question 10: Ductal-Dependent Lesion - PGE₁ Therapy

- **Subject:** Pharmacology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Transposition of Great Arteries (Prostaglandin Therapy)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A term male newborn becomes severely cyanotic within 30 minutes after birth. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. On examination, the infant is tachypneic with subcostal retractions, a single loud S₂, and no significant murmur. Pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturations of 68% on room air and 70% after 10 minutes of 100% oxygen. Chest radiograph shows a narrow mediastinum. The infant is started on an intravenous drug that rapidly improves oxygenation by promoting blood mixing between the pulmonary and systemic circulations.

**Question**

This medication acts through which of the following mechanisms?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Activation of prostaglandin E (EP) receptors on ductal smooth muscle
- ⬜ **B.** Activation of nitric-oxide synthase in pulmonary vascular endothelium
- ⬜ **C.** Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2)
- ⬜ **D.** Blockade of endothelin-1 receptors
- ⬜ **E.** Inhibition of phosphodiesterase III in cardiac myocytes
- ⬜ **F.** Competitive inhibition of phospholipase A₂

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

This infant has transposition of the great arteries (TGA), suggested by profound cyanosis at birth, minimal response to 100% oxygen (failed hyperoxia test), single loud S₂, and a narrow mediastinum ("egg-on-a-string"). In TGA, systemic and pulmonary circulations run in parallel. Survival depends on mixing through a PDA, ASD, or VSD. Prostaglandin E₁ (alprostadil) binds Gₛ-coupled EP receptors on ductal smooth muscle, increasing cAMP and producing vasodilation that maintains ductal patency until definitive repair.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Nitric-oxide synthase activation causes systemic vasodilation but does not target the ductus.
- **C.** COX inhibition by NSAIDs lowers PGE₂ levels and closes the ductus—the opposite of what is needed.
- **D.** Endothelin-1 receptor blockade treats pulmonary hypertension, not ductal patency.
- **E.** PDE III inhibitors (eg, milrinone) increase inotropy and vasodilation but do not affect the ductus.
- **F.** Phospholipase A₂ inhibition by corticosteroids broadly suppresses eicosanoids and is not used for ductal maintenance.

**Rapid review**

- Ductal-dependent lesions (TGA, pulmonary/tricuspid atresia, critical coarctation) require immediate PGE₁ infusion.
- Mechanism: EP receptor activation → ↑ cAMP → ductal smooth muscle relaxation.
- Monitor for adverse effects including apnea, fever, and hypotension.

## Question 11: PDA Ligation - Nerve Injury

- **Subject:** Anatomy
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Patent Ductus Arteriosus (Surgical Complications)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 3-week-old infant develops respiratory distress and a continuous murmur heard best below the left clavicle. Surgical correction is performed through a left thoracotomy. Several hours later, the infant's cry becomes weak and the chest radiograph shows an elevated left hemidiaphragm. Laryngoscopy reveals the left vocal cord fixed in a paramedian position, but the right cord moves normally.

**Question**

Which of the following best explains both postoperative findings?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Ligation injury to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve coursing posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum
- ⬜ **B.** Ischemic neuropathy of the left phrenic nerve running anterior to the lung root
- ⬜ **C.** Bilateral vagal nerve traction near the esophageal hiatus
- ⬜ **D.** Transection of the left sympathetic chain adjacent to the aortic arch
- ⬜ **E.** Entrapment of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve under the right subclavian artery

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

The left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), a branch of the vagus nerve, loops under the aortic arch posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum (the remnant of the ductus arteriosus). PDA ligation in this region risks injuring the left RLN, producing ipsilateral vocal-cord paralysis (weak cry, hoarseness) and occasionally diaphragmatic dysfunction if neighboring vagal fibers are affected. The elevated left hemidiaphragm and hoarse cry both stem from this injury pattern.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Phrenic nerve injury would paralyze the diaphragm but would not affect vocal cord movement.
- **C.** Bilateral vagal traction would impair both vocal cords and cause parasympathetic symptoms.
- **D.** Sympathetic chain transection causes Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis), not vocal cord paralysis.
- **E.** The right RLN loops under the right subclavian artery in the neck and is not compromised during PDA surgery.

**Rapid review**

- Left RLN loops under the aortic arch posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum (derivative of the left sixth arch).
- Injury → hoarseness, weak cry, stridor, possible diaphragmatic dysfunction.
- Think "Ortner syndrome" when an enlarged left atrium compresses the left RLN.

## Question 12: Transposition of Great Arteries - Embryology

- **Subject:** Embryology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Transposition of Great Arteries (Embryologic Development)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term male infant born at 39 weeks gestation becomes notably cyanotic shortly after delivery. Fetal ultrasound during the third trimester had identified abnormal positioning of the great vessels. Despite ongoing prostaglandin E₁ therapy, pulse oximetry remains at 50% on the right upper extremity and 51% on the left lower extremity. Postnatal echocardiography demonstrates d-transposition of the great arteries with a highly restrictive patent foramen ovale (1.5 mm) and a large patent ductus arteriosus.

**Question**

Which embryologic mechanism best explains this infant's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Failure of the aorticopulmonary (conotruncal) septum to spiral
- ⬜ **B.** Anterior malalignment of the infundibular septum
- ⬜ **C.** Failure of the endocardial cushions to fuse
- ⬜ **D.** Failure of the pulmonary veins to connect to the left atrium
- ⬜ **E.** Failure of the truncus arteriosus to divide due to neural crest migration defect

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

During weeks 5-6 of gestation, neural crest cells drive formation of the aorticopulmonary (AP) septum. Normally, the truncal ridges spiral, allowing the aorta and pulmonary artery to criss-cross and connect to the appropriate ventricles. If the septum fails to spiral, the great vessels remain parallel, producing d-transposition of the great arteries (aorta from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery from the left ventricle). Survival hinges on intercirculatory mixing via a PDA, ASD, or VSD.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Anterior malalignment of the infundibular septum causes Tetralogy of Fallot.
- **C.** Endocardial cushion fusion failure results in atrioventricular septal defects (common AV valve), often in Down syndrome.
- **D.** Failed pulmonary vein connection produces total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR).
- **E.** Complete failure of truncal division leads to persistent truncus arteriosus (single outflow tract), not TGA.

**Rapid review**

- Failed AP septal spiraling → ventriculoarterial discordance → d-TGA.
- Presents with severe cyanosis at birth and narrow mediastinum on CXR.
- Requires PGE₁ infusion and balloon atrial septostomy before arterial switch surgery.

## Question 13: Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) - Complete AVSD

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Down Syndrome (Cardiac Manifestations)
- **Difficulty:** Easy (★1/5)
- **Estimated time:** 75 seconds

**Vignette**

A 4-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician for poor feeding and failure to gain weight. He was born at term to a 37-year-old woman after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Physical examination reveals mild generalized hypotonia, a soft holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, and mild abdominal distension. The infant has up-slanting palpebral fissures and a short neck with excess skin folds posteriorly. Abdominal radiography demonstrates a "double-bubble" gas pattern.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this infant's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** 45, X (Turner syndrome)
- ⬜ **B.** 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)
- ✅ **C.** 47, XY, +21 (Down syndrome)
- ⬜ **D.** 47, XY, +18 (Edwards syndrome)
- ⬜ **E.** 47, XY, +13 (Patau syndrome)

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

This infant exhibits hallmark Down syndrome findings: hypotonia, up-slanting palpebral fissures, redundant nuchal skin, duodenal atresia ("double bubble"), and a holosystolic murmur from an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). Down syndrome most often results from maternal meiotic nondisjunction leading to trisomy 21.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Turner syndrome presents in phenotypic females with streak ovaries, webbed neck, and coarctation of the aorta.
- **B.** Klinefelter syndrome manifests in males at puberty with tall stature, small testes, and infertility.
- **D.** Edwards syndrome features clenched fists, rocker-bottom feet, and severe growth restriction.
- **E.** Patau syndrome produces midline defects (holoprosencephaly, cleft lip/palate) and polydactyly.

**Rapid review**

- Down syndrome → endocardial cushion defect → complete AVSD most common.
- Associated with duodenal atresia, Hirschsprung disease, acute leukemias.
- Advanced maternal age is the primary risk factor via nondisjunction.

## Question 14: Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome)

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Edwards Syndrome (Clinical Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Easy (★1/5)
- **Estimated time:** 75 seconds

**Vignette**

A small-for-gestational-age premature girl is delivered at 36 weeks to a 39-year-old mother. The pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Physical examination reveals micrognathia, low-set ears, and hands that remain tightly clenched with the index finger overlapping the middle finger and the little finger overlapping the ring finger. The infant's feet have a flat plantar surface with a prominent heel. A harsh systolic murmur is heard along the left lower sternal border.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this infant's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
- ✅ **B.** Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)
- ⬜ **C.** Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
- ⬜ **D.** Turner syndrome (45, X)
- ⬜ **E.** Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY)

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) is characterized by growth restriction, micrognathia, overlapping clenched fingers, rocker-bottom feet, and congenital heart disease (often VSD). These findings, along with polyhydramnios and poor postnatal survival, point to trisomy 18 caused by meiotic nondisjunction.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Patau syndrome produces midline defects (cleft lip/palate, omphalocele) and polydactyly.
- **C.** Down syndrome features hypotonia, flat facies, and single palmar creases.
- **D.** Turner syndrome affects phenotypic females with streak ovaries, webbed neck, and coarctation.
- **E.** Klinefelter syndrome presents in males with hypogonadism and tall stature at puberty.

**Rapid review**

- Trisomy 18 → overlapping clenched fists + rocker-bottom feet.
- Cardiac defects commonly include VSD, ASD, PDA.
- Prognosis is poor; most infants die within the first year.

## Question 15: Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome)

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Patau Syndrome (Clinical Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Easy (★1/5)
- **Estimated time:** 75 seconds

**Vignette**

A small-for-gestational-age premature infant is born to a 38-year-old woman after limited prenatal care. Physical examination reveals microcephaly, microphthalmia, and a cleft lip and palate. There is a punched-out scalp lesion covered by a thin membrane and a membranous sac containing bowel protruding from the abdominal midline. Extra digits are present on both hands.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Trisomy 21
- ✅ **B.** Trisomy 13
- ⬜ **C.** Trisomy 18
- ⬜ **D.** 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)
- ⬜ **E.** 45, X (Turner syndrome)
- ⬜ **F.** Triploidy (69, XXX or 69, XXY)

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) produces classic midline defects—holoprosencephaly, cleft lip/palate, microphthalmia, omphalocele—as well as cutis aplasia and polydactyly. These abnormalities result from defective fusion of the prechordal mesoderm due to an extra chromosome 13.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Down syndrome lacks midline craniofacial and abdominal wall defects.
- **C.** Edwards syndrome features clenched fists and rocker-bottom feet, not polydactyly.
- **D/E.** Klinefelter and Turner syndromes involve sex-chromosome abnormalities with distinct adolescent or female presentations.
- **F.** Triploidy causes numerous anomalies and is typically lethal early in gestation.

**Rapid review**

- Trisomy 13 → midline defects + polydactyly + cutis aplasia.
- Frequently associated with VSD or PDA.
- Most affected infants die within 6 months.

## Question 16: Turner Syndrome - Coarctation

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Turner Syndrome (Cardiac Manifestations)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 14-year-old girl is evaluated for primary amenorrhea. She has never had menarche and reports poor breast development. Her height is below the 5th percentile. On examination, she has a short, broad neck with lateral skin folds, a low posterior hairline, and widely spaced nipples. Cardiac auscultation reveals a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Blood pressure is higher in the arms than in the legs. Pelvic ultrasound shows a small uterus and streak-like gonads.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this patient's findings?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** 45, X (monosomy X)
- ⬜ **B.** 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)
- ⬜ **C.** 46, XX, 5p deletion (Cri-du-chat syndrome)
- ⬜ **D.** 47, XX, +18 (Edwards syndrome)
- ⬜ **E.** 46, XY, 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

Turner syndrome arises from complete or partial monosomy X, leading to streak ovaries, short stature (SHOX gene haploinsufficiency), webbed neck, and broad chest. Cardiac manifestations include bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta, explaining the arm-leg blood pressure gradient and systolic murmur. Estrogen deficiency causes primary amenorrhea and poor secondary sexual development.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Klinefelter syndrome affects phenotypic males who present with tall stature, gynecomastia, and infertility.
- **C.** Cri-du-chat syndrome presents with microcephaly, cat-like cry, and facial anomalies rather than Turner features.
- **D.** Edwards syndrome manifests in infancy with clenched hands and rocker-bottom feet.
- **E.** DiGeorge syndrome presents neonatally with conotruncal defects, hypocalcemia, and thymic aplasia.

**Rapid review**

- Turner syndrome → monosomy X → streak ovaries, short stature, coarctation/bicuspid aortic valve.
- Elevated FSH/LH with low estrogen due to gonadal dysgenesis.
- Treat with growth hormone and estrogen replacement.
