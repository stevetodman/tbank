          "correct": "This child has Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease in children beyond infancy. ToF consists of: Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary stenosis), Right ventricular hypertrophy, Ventricular septal defect (VSD), and Overriding aorta. Cyanosis results from a right-to-left shunt through the VSD caused by obstruction to pulmonary flow. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR) without significantly increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The elevated SVR directs more blood into the pulmonary circulation rather than across the VSD into the aorta, thereby improving arterial oxygenation.",

This right-to-left shunt lowers arterial O₂ saturation and produces intense cyanosis.
