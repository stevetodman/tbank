## Question 33: Vascular Ring - Right Aortic Arch with Aberrant Left Subclavian

- **Subject:** Anatomy/Pathology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Vascular Rings (Right Aortic Arch)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 6-month-old infant is brought to the pediatrician for evaluation of noisy breathing and difficulty swallowing solids. The parents report the infant has had stridor since birth that worsens with feeding and when lying supine. The infant frequently coughs and gags when eating pureed foods. Physical examination reveals inspiratory stridor and mild intercostal retractions. Cardiac examination shows normal S1 and S2 without murmurs. Chest radiograph shows the aortic arch on the right side. Barium esophagram demonstrates a posterior indentation of the esophagus. CT angiography shows a right-sided aortic arch with the left subclavian artery arising as the fourth branch and coursing posterior to the esophagus.

**Question**

Which of the following embryologic structures contributes to the formation of this patient's vascular anomaly?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Persistence of the left fourth aortic arch
- ✅ **B.** Persistence of the right fourth aortic arch
- ⬜ **C.** Failure of regression of the right dorsal aorta
- ⬜ **D.** Persistence of the left sixth aortic arch
- ⬜ **E.** Abnormal migration of neural crest cells

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery that courses posterior to the esophagus, creating a vascular ring. Normally, the left fourth aortic arch persists to form the transverse arch while the right fourth arch regresses. In this anomaly, the right fourth arch persists and the left fourth arch regresses, placing the arch on the right side. The aberrant left subclavian artery becomes the last branch and travels behind the esophagus, and together with the ligamentum arteriosum forms a ring that compresses the trachea and esophagus, leading to stridor and dysphagia lusoria.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Persistence of the left fourth arch is normal development and would produce a left-sided arch.
- **C.** Right dorsal aorta persistence influences descending aorta configuration but is not the key driver of a right arch.
- **D.** The sixth arches form the proximal pulmonary arteries and ductus arteriosus; persistence would create a PDA.
- **E.** Neural crest migration defects cause conotruncal abnormalities (e.g., truncus arteriosus, TOF), not isolated vascular rings.

**Educational objective**

Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery arises from persistence of the right fourth aortic arch and regression of the left fourth arch, forming a vascular ring that compresses the trachea and esophagus.

**Rapid review**

- Right arch = persistent right 4th arch
- Aberrant left subclavian passes behind esophagus
- Dysphagia lusoria + inspiratory stridor
- Posterior indentation on barium esophagram
- Distinguish from mirror-image right arch (usually asymptomatic)

## Question 34: Patent Foramen Ovale and Paradoxical Embolus

- **Subject:** Pathophysiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Patent Foramen Ovale (Clinical Findings)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 38-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia that began 2 hours ago. She has no significant past medical history except for a recent 8-hour international flight one week ago, during which she noticed her right calf became swollen and tender. On examination, she has right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia. MRI brain shows an acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Venous Doppler ultrasound of the right leg reveals a deep venous thrombosis in the femoral vein. Transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study shows passage of microbubbles from the right atrium to the left atrium within three cardiac cycles following injection.

**Question**

Which of the following physical examination findings would most likely be present in this patient?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Fixed splitting of the second heart sound
- ⬜ **B.** Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
- ⬜ **C.** Continuous machinery murmur at the left infraclavicular area
- ⬜ **D.** Mid-systolic click with late systolic murmur
- ✅ **E.** Normal cardiac examination

**Correct answer:** E

**Explanation**

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) persists when the septum primum and secundum fail to fuse. It typically remains functionally closed because left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure. Transient right atrial pressure surges (e.g., Valsalva, coughing, straining during long flights) can force a right-to-left shunt, allowing venous thrombi to bypass the lungs and cause a paradoxical embolus, as occurred in this patient. The opening is small and usually closed at rest, so no turbulence or significant flow occurs—producing a completely normal cardiac examination.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Fixed S2 splitting characterizes atrial septal defect with significant left-to-right shunt, not a PFO.
- **B.** A holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border indicates VSD or tricuspid regurgitation.
- **C.** A continuous machinery murmur is classic for patent ductus arteriosus.
- **D.** A mid-systolic click with late systolic murmur occurs with mitral valve prolapse.

**Educational objective**

Patent foramen ovale can permit paradoxical emboli but does not produce murmurs or abnormal heart sounds; the physical exam is typically normal.

**Rapid review**

- PFO in ~25-30% of adults
- Paradoxical embolus = venous clot → systemic circulation
- Triggered by transient ↑ right atrial pressure
- Bubble study confirms right-to-left shunt
- Normal auscultation distinguishes from ASD

## Question 35: Fetal Circulation - Transition at Birth

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Fetal-Neonatal Transition (Pulmonary Hemodynamics)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn is delivered via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. Immediately after birth, the infant begins to cry vigorously and the umbilical cord is clamped. The neonate's oxygen saturation, initially 60% at 1 minute of life, rises to 92% by 5 minutes of life. The infant is pink with good perfusion. The obstetrician explains to the medical student that several important cardiovascular changes occurred within the first few minutes after birth that allowed the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation.

**Question**

Which of the following hemodynamic changes occurs as a direct result of lung expansion at birth?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Increased systemic vascular resistance from cord clamping
- ⬜ **B.** Closure of the foramen ovale due to reversal of atrial pressure gradient
- ✅ **C.** Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance from alveolar oxygenation
- ⬜ **D.** Constriction of the ductus arteriosus from increased oxygen tension
- ⬜ **E.** Closure of the ductus venosus from cessation of umbilical venous flow

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

The first breaths expand the lungs, stretch the pulmonary vasculature, and expose pulmonary arterioles to high oxygen tension, a powerful vasodilator. Pulmonary vascular resistance falls sharply, increasing pulmonary blood flow nearly tenfold. The resulting rise in pulmonary venous return elevates left atrial pressure, leading secondarily to functional closure of the foramen ovale and other circulatory changes.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Systemic vascular resistance increases immediately after the cord is clamped due to loss of the low-resistance placenta.
- **B.** Foramen ovale closure occurs **after** pulmonary flow increases and left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure.
- **D.** Ductus arteriosus constriction is triggered by elevated oxygen tension and falling prostaglandins, taking hours.
- **E.** Ductus venosus closure is driven by the loss of umbilical venous return following cord clamping.

**Educational objective**

Lung expansion at birth directly lowers pulmonary vascular resistance via oxygen-mediated vasodilation, enabling increased pulmonary blood flow and initiating the neonatal circulatory transition.

**Rapid review**

- Birth breaths → ↓↓↓ PVR
- ↑ Pulmonary flow → ↑ LA pressure → closes foramen ovale
- Cord clamping → ↑ SVR
- ↑ PaO₂ + ↓ prostaglandins → close ductus arteriosus (hours)
- Loss of umbilical flow → close ductus venosus

## Question 36: Oxygen Step-Up Study - Cardiac Catheterization

- **Subject:** Physiology/Diagnostics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Cardiac Catheterization (Oxygen Saturation Analysis)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 2-year-old boy undergoes cardiac catheterization for evaluation of a cardiac murmur and mild cyanosis. Oxygen saturation measurements are obtained from various cardiac chambers and great vessels. The results show: superior vena cava 65%, inferior vena cava 68%, right atrium 67%, right ventricle 82%, pulmonary artery 81%, pulmonary veins 98%, left atrium 97%, left ventricle 85%, and ascending aorta 84%. The patient's systemic and pulmonary blood flows are calculated to be approximately equal.

**Question**

Based on these oxygen saturation measurements, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt
- ✅ **B.** Ventricular septal defect with bidirectional shunt
- ⬜ **C.** Patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right shunt
- ⬜ **D.** Total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right atrium
- ⬜ **E.** Tetralogy of Fallot with significant right-to-left shunt

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

An oxygen saturation step-up between the right atrium (67%) and right ventricle (82%) localizes a left-to-right shunt to the ventricular level. Simultaneous desaturation of the left ventricle and aorta (mid-80s) shows that some blood is moving right-to-left. This bidirectional flow pattern is classic for a ventricular septal defect in which pulmonary vascular resistance approaches systemic levels, allowing flow in both directions depending on the pressure gradient.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** An atrial septal defect would cause a step-up at the atrial level and would not desaturate systemic arterial blood.
- **C.** A patent ductus arteriosus produces a step-up between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery; those values are equal here.
- **D.** Total anomalous pulmonary venous return yields markedly elevated right atrial saturation and low left atrial saturation, which is not observed.
- **E.** Tetralogy of Fallot with significant right-to-left shunting produces uniformly low right-sided saturations without a ventricular step-up.

**Educational objective**

A right ventricular oxygen saturation step-up combined with systemic desaturation indicates bidirectional shunting across a ventricular septal defect due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

**Rapid review**

- Step-up site localizes shunt (RV → VSD)
- Bidirectional flow when PVR ≈ SVR
- Aortic desaturation = right-to-left component
- PDA step-up occurs in pulmonary artery
- ASD step-up occurs in right atrium

## Question 37: Turner Syndrome - Associated Cardiac Defects

- **Subject:** Genetics/Pathology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Turner Syndrome (Cardiac Associations)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the clinic for evaluation of short stature and absent menstrual periods. Physical examination reveals a height of 4 feet 8 inches, webbed neck, shield chest with widely spaced nipples, and a low posterior hairline. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates a blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg in both arms and decreased femoral pulses. A systolic ejection murmur is heard at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the back between the scapulae. Karyotype analysis shows 45,X. Echocardiography is ordered to evaluate for congenital heart disease.

**Question**

Which of the following cardiac abnormalities is most likely to be found in this patient?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Atrial septal defect with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return
- ✅ **B.** Bicuspid aortic valve with coarctation of the aorta
- ⬜ **C.** Atrioventricular septal defect with common atrioventricular valve
- ⬜ **D.** Ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation
- ⬜ **E.** Tetralogy of Fallot with right aortic arch

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

Turner syndrome (45,X) is highly associated with left-sided obstructive lesions—most commonly bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta. Hypertension in the arms, diminished femoral pulses, and a systolic murmur radiating to the back point to coarctation, whereas a right upper sternal border systolic ejection murmur suggests a bicuspid valve.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is less common in Turner syndrome and would not explain the arm-leg pulse differential.
- **C.** Atrioventricular septal defect is strongly linked to trisomy 21, not Turner syndrome.
- **D.** VSD with aortic regurgitation would produce holosystolic and diastolic murmurs rather than isolated arm-leg blood pressure differences.
- **E.** Tetralogy of Fallot with a right aortic arch is associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndromes.

**Educational objective**

Patients with Turner syndrome commonly have bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta, leading to upper extremity hypertension, diminished femoral pulses, and a systolic murmur radiating to the back.

**Rapid review**

- Turner syndrome → left-sided obstructive lesions
- Bicuspid aortic valve (~30-50%)
- Coarctation (~10-15%) with arm-leg BP gradient
- Requires lifelong aortic imaging
- Monitor for aortic dilation/dissection risk
