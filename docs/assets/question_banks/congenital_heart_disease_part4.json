The parents report the infant has had stridor since birth that worsens with feeding and when lying supine. The infant frequently coughs and gags when eating pureed foods. Physical examination reveals inspiratory stridor and mild intercostal retractions. Cardiac examination shows normal S1 and S2 without murmurs. Chest radiograph shows the aortic arch on the right side. Barium esophagram demonstrates a posterior indentation of the esophagus. CT angiography shows a right-sided aortic arch with the left subclavian artery arising as the fourth branch and coursing posterior to the esophagus.",

          "correct": "This infant has a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery—a vascular ring that causes dysphagia lusoria (difficulty swallowing) and stridor from compression of the esophagus and trachea. Normal development: The left fourth aortic arch normally persists to form the transverse aortic arch, while the right fourth arch regresses. In this anomaly, the opposite occurs: the right fourth aortic arch persists (forming the arch on the right side), and the left fourth arch regresses. The left subclavian artery arises as the last (fourth) branch of the aortic arch and courses leftward behind the esophagus to reach the left arm. When combined with a ligamentum arteriosum (remnant of ductus arteriosus) connecting the left pulmonary artery to the descending aorta, a complete vascular ring forms around the trachea and esophagus. The posterior compression from the aberrant left subclavian artery causes the characteristic posterior esophageal indentation on barium study. This differs from mirror-image right aortic arch (associated with TOF), which is typically asymptomatic because there's no posterior vessel and no complete ring.",

          "correct": "This patient has suffered a paradoxical embolus—a venous thrombus that crossed from the venous system to the arterial system through a patent foramen ovale (PFO), causing a stroke. The bubble study confirms a PFO: microbubbles appeared in the left heart after right heart injection, proving right-to-left shunting at the atrial level. A PFO is present in approximately 25-30% of adults and results from incomplete fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum. It remains functionally closed as long as left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure. However, transient increases in right atrial pressure (Valsalva, cough, straining during air travel) can cause temporary right-to-left shunting, allowing venous emboli to bypass the lungs. Critically, a PFO does not cause any cardiac murmur or abnormal heart sounds because the orifice is small and usually not traversed at rest. Therefore, the cardiac examination is completely normal.",
