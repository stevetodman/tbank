ToF consists of: Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary stenosis), Right ventricular hypertrophy, Ventricular septal defect (VSD), and Overriding aorta. Cyanosis results from a right-to-left shunt through the VSD caused by obstruction to pulmonary flow. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR) without significantly increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The elevated SVR directs more blood into the pulmonary circulation rather than across the VSD into the aorta, thereby improving arterial oxygenation.",

In d-TGA, the septum forms 'straight' instead of spiraled, causing the aorta to connect to right ventricle and pulmonary artery to connect to left ventricle, creating parallel circulations. This results in deoxygenated blood (RV \u2192 Aorta \u2192 body) and oxygenated blood (LV \u2192 PA \u2192 lungs), with survival requiring mixing (PDA, ASD, VSD).",

In TAPVR, all four pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium and instead drain anomalously into the systemic venous system. In the infracardiac type, a vertical vein descends through the diaphragm to join the portal venous system or ductus venosus. This pathway is inherently restrictive because: (1) the vertical vein traverses the diaphragm and can be compressed during breathing, (2) the hepatic sinusoids offer high resistance, and (3) mixing with deoxygenated blood occurs before reaching the heart. Obstruction causes severe pulmonary venous congestion with pulmonary edema (ground-glass appearance on CXR mimicking respiratory distress syndrome), pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The infant presents with severe cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen because blood cannot adequately return from the lungs. The normal heart size distinguishes this from typical CHF (which causes cardiomegaly). This is a surgical emergency\u2014delayed diagnosis is fatal.",

The hemodynamic consequence is torrential pulmonary blood flow because: (1) the pulmonary arteries receive blood directly from the high-pressure truncus (systemic-level pressure), (2) as pulmonary vascular resistance naturally drops in the first weeks of life, pulmonary blood flow increases dramatically, and (3) there is obligate complete mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the common trunk.

However, as PVR drops over the first weeks of life, pulmonary artery pressure falls dramatically, resulting in: (1) decreased perfusion pressure to the left coronary system \u2192 myocardial ischemia, (2) reversal of flow in the left coronary artery (blood flows from the RCA via collaterals TO the LCA and then into the low-pressure pulmonary artery\u2014a 'coronary steal'), (3) chronic myocardial ischemia \u2192 anterolateral MI \u2192 LV dysfunction, mitral regurgitation (from papillary muscle dysfunction), and CHF.

In HLHS, systemic blood flow is ENTIRELY dependent on the right ventricle and patent ductus arteriosus: (1) the RV pumps blood to the pulmonary artery, (2) blood reaches the lungs normally, (3) oxygenated blood returns to the LA but cannot enter the hypoplastic LV, (4) blood crosses the atrial septum (R\u2192L) to reach the RA and RV, (5) from the pulmonary artery, blood flows RETROGRADE through the PDA to supply the systemic circulation (including coronaries, which fill retrograde from the descending aorta). When the ductus begins to close (as it naturally does after birth), systemic perfusion ceases catastrophically \u2192 shock, acidosis, absent pulses, death. The IMMEDIATE intervention is prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductal patency and restore systemic blood flow. This buys time for stabilization and surgical planning (Norwood procedure or cardiac transplant). Without PGE1, the infant will die within hours.",

            "A": "Atrial septostomy - Atrial septostomy (balloon dilation of the atrial septum) is used to improve mixing when the atrial communication is restrictive.

Improving atrial mixing won't restore systemic perfusion if the duct is closed. PGE1 is the first priority.",

High FiO2 causes pulmonary vasodilation, which increases pulmonary blood flow (Qp) at the expense of systemic blood flow (Qs). This worsens systemic perfusion. The goal in HLHS is BALANCED Qp:Qs (ideally 1:1), achieved by limiting oxygen (keep FiO2 ~21%, sats 75-85%) and sometimes adding CO2 to maintain PVR. Oxygen does not address the closed duct.",
