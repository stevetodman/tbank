In TAPVR, all four pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium and instead drain anomalously into the systemic venous system. In the infracardiac type, a vertical vein descends through the diaphragm to join the portal venous system or ductus venosus. This pathway is inherently restrictive because: (1) the vertical vein traverses the diaphragm and can be compressed during breathing, (2) the hepatic sinusoids offer high resistance, and (3) mixing with deoxygenated blood occurs before reaching the heart. Obstruction causes severe pulmonary venous congestion with pulmonary edema (ground-glass appearance on CXR mimicking respiratory distress syndrome), pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The infant presents with severe cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen because blood cannot adequately return from the lungs.

In this rare congenital anomaly, the left coronary artery arises from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta. Pathophysiology: In utero and immediately after birth, pulmonary artery pressure is elevated (near systemic), so the left coronary artery receives adequate flow. However, as PVR drops over the first weeks of life, pulmonary artery pressure falls dramatically, resulting in: (1) decreased perfusion pressure to the left coronary system → myocardial ischemia, (2) reversal of flow in the left coronary artery (blood flows from the RCA via collaterals TO the LCA and then into the low-pressure pulmonary artery—a 'coronary steal'), (3) chronic myocardial ischemia → anterolateral MI → LV dysfunction, mitral regurgitation (from papillary muscle dysfunction), and CHF. Presentation mimics angina in infants: irritability, sweating, inconsolable crying during feeds (when cardiac demand increases). ECG shows anterolateral MI pattern (deep Q waves in I and aVL). Echo shows bright myocardial areas (fibrosis/infarction) and severe LV dysfunction. This is a surgical emergency—the LCA must be reimplanted into the aorta.",

Echo findings of bright myocardium in a specific distribution (anterolateral) point to infarction, not diffuse myocarditis.",
            "C": "Dilated cardiomyopathy - Idiopathic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy can present with heart failure in infancy but typically shows global ventricular dilation and diffuse hypokinesis without regional wall motion abnormalities. The ECG wouldn't show pathologic Q waves (indicating MI). The clinical presentation (episodes of irritability/pain during feeding) strongly suggests ischemia rather than primary muscle disease.",
            "D": "Critical aortic stenosis - Presents in the first days/weeks of life (not months) with shock, poor perfusion, and ductal-dependent systemic circulation. Echo would show severe aortic valve stenosis and concentric LV hypertrophy with or without endocardial fibroelastosis. There would be no regional wall motion abnormalities or MI pattern on ECG—the LV dysfunction is global from pressure overload, not ischemia.",

This infant has none of these features. Additionally, Kawasaki typically affects older infants/toddlers (peak 18-24 months), and coronary complications occur 2-4 weeks after fever onset, not as the presenting finding at 4 months."

In HLHS, systemic blood flow is ENTIRELY dependent on the right ventricle and patent ductus arteriosus: (1) the RV pumps blood to the pulmonary artery, (2) blood reaches the lungs normally, (3) oxygenated blood returns to the LA but cannot enter the hypoplastic LV, (4) blood crosses the atrial septum (R→L) to reach the RA and RV, (5) from the pulmonary artery, blood flows RETROGRADE through the PDA to supply the systemic circulation (including coronaries, which fill retrograde from the descending aorta). When the ductus begins to close (as it naturally does after birth), systemic perfusion ceases catastrophically → shock, acidosis, absent pulses, death. The IMMEDIATE intervention is prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductal patency and restore systemic blood flow. This buys time for stabilization and surgical planning (Norwood procedure or cardiac transplant). Without PGE1, the infant will die within hours.",
          "incorrect": {
            "A": "Atrial septostomy - Atrial septostomy (balloon dilation of the atrial septum) is used to improve mixing when the atrial communication is restrictive. While HLHS does require adequate atrial-level shunting for survival, the PRIMARY problem in this decompensating infant is DUCTAL CLOSURE causing loss of systemic blood flow. Improving atrial mixing won't restore systemic perfusion if the duct is closed. PGE1 is the first priority.",
            "C": "Supplemental oxygen - In HLHS, excessive oxygen is actually HARMFUL. High FiO2 causes pulmonary vasodilation, which increases pulmonary blood flow (Qp) at the expense of systemic blood flow (Qs). This worsens systemic perfusion. The goal in HLHS is BALANCED Qp:Qs (ideally 1:1), achieved by limiting oxygen (keep FiO2 ~21%, sats 75-85%) and sometimes adding CO2 to maintain PVR. Oxygen does not address the closed duct.",
            "D": "Inotropes - While inotropic support may be used as an adjunct for shock, it does NOT address the fundamental problem: the duct is closing and there is no pathway for systemic blood flow. Dopamine and milrinone will not restore systemic perfusion if the ductus is closed. PGE1 must be given first to reopen the duct, then inotropes may help support cardiac output.",
            "E": "Close the PDA - This would be FATAL. The PDA is the ONLY source of systemic blood flow in HLHS. Closing it would eliminate all systemic circulation and cause immediate death. The goal is to keep the ductus OPEN (with PGE1), not close it."
