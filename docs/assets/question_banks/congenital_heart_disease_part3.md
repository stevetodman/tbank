## Question 17: Williams Syndrome - 7q11.23 Deletion

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Williams Syndrome (Clinical Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 5-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for evaluation of developmental delay. His parents describe him as "extremely friendly" and talkative, with an unusual affinity for music and strangers. Physical examination shows a small, upturned nose; long philtrum; full lips and cheeks; and a wide mouth ("elfin" facies). He has a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Blood pressure is normal. Serum calcium is mildly elevated.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this child's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** 5p deletion (Cri-du-chat syndrome)
- ✅ **B.** 7q11.23 microdeletion involving the elastin gene
- ⬜ **C.** 11p15 imprinting defect (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome)
- ⬜ **D.** 15q11-13 paternal deletion (Prader–Willi syndrome)
- ⬜ **E.** 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This child has Williams syndrome, caused by microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23 including the elastin (ELN) gene. Key features include: Cardiac abnormalities (supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis due to loss of elastin → connective tissue abnormality), Facial features ("elfin" facies with broad forehead, short nose, full cheeks/lips, wide mouth), Personality (extremely social, outgoing, "cocktail party personality"; affinity for music), Metabolic findings (hypercalcemia in infancy from ↑ vitamin D sensitivity), and Cognitive features (mild-moderate intellectual disability, but strong expressive language).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** 5p deletion (Cri-du-chat) presents with "cat-like" cry, microcephaly, wide-spaced eyes; different phenotype.
- **C.** 11p15 imprinting (Beckwith-Wiedemann) presents with macroglossia, organomegaly, omphalocele, Wilms tumor risk; not cardiac/facial pattern here.
- **D.** 15q11-13 paternal deletion (Prader–Willi) presents with hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature; different features.
- **E.** 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge) presents with conotruncal heart defects, thymic hypoplasia, hypocalcemia (opposite), cleft palate; not this pattern.

**Educational objective**

Williams syndrome results from a microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23 including the elastin (ELN) gene. Loss of elastin causes supravalvular aortic stenosis. Patients have "elfin" facial features, an outgoing personality, strong verbal skills, and often hypercalcemia.

**Rapid review**

## Question 18: 22q11 Deletion (DiGeorge) - Truncus Arteriosus

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** DiGeorge Syndrome (Cardiac Manifestations)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A term neonate presents on day 2 of life with cyanosis and poor perfusion. Physical examination shows a single loud S2 and a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Chest radiograph reveals an absent thymic shadow. Serum calcium is 6.5 mg/dL (low). Echocardiography demonstrates a persistent truncus arteriosus with a VSD.

**Question**

Which of the following genetic conditions best explains these findings?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** 22q11.2 deletion
- ⬜ **B.** Autosomal trisomy
- ⬜ **C.** Fibrillin mutation
- ⬜ **D.** Frataxin mutation
- ⬜ **E.** Hamartin gene mutation
- ⬜ **F.** Sex chromosome monosomy

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

This neonate has 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge), characterized by: Cardiac abnormalities (conotruncal anomalies including truncus arteriosus, TOF, interrupted aortic arch), Thymic aplasia/hypoplasia → T-cell immunodeficiency (absent thymic shadow), Parathyroid aplasia → hypocalcemia, and other features (cleft palate, learning disabilities). The embryologic mechanism involves failed development of 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches (neural crest defect). CATCH-22 mnemonic: Cardiac abnormalities (conotruncal), Abnormal facies, Thymic aplasia, Cleft palate, Hypocalcemia, 22 = chromosome 22.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Trisomy 21 is strongly linked to AVSD, not truncus arteriosus.
- **C.** Fibrillin (Marfan) causes aortic root disease in adolescents/young adults, not neonatal conotruncal lesions.
- **D.** Frataxin (Friedreich ataxia) causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; neurologic disease appears later.
- **E.** Hamartin (TSC1, tuberous sclerosis) causes rhabdomyomas, seizures, cortical tubers; not conotruncal with thymic/parathyroid aplasia.
- **F.** Turner (45,X) causes coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve; occurs in females.

**Educational objective**

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge) causes conotruncal anomalies (truncus arteriosus, TOF), thymic aplasia (absent thymic shadow), and hypocalcemia from parathyroid aplasia due to failed development of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches.

**Rapid review**

- CATCH-22 mnemonic
- Conotruncal defects (truncus, TOF, IAA)
- Hypocalcemia (parathyroid aplasia)
- Absent thymus → recurrent infections
- Facial: hypertelorism, low-set ears, micrognathia

## Question 19: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy - Murmur Maneuvers

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Physical Examination)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 24-year-old man with exertional dyspnea is diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). On auscultation, a harsh systolic murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border.

**Question**

Which maneuver will decrease the intensity of this murmur?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Sudden standing (from squatting to standing)
- ⬜ **B.** Straining phase of Valsalva maneuver
- ✅ **C.** Squatting from standing position
- ⬜ **D.** Administration of nitroglycerin
- ⬜ **E.** Inspiration

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

HCM murmur physiology: Obstruction varies inversely with LV volume. Smaller LV → more septal–mitral leaflet contact → louder murmur. Larger LV → less contact → softer murmur. Squatting: ↑ preload **and** ↑ afterload → ↑ LV end-diastolic volume → murmur softens. This is the "rebel murmur" that behaves opposite to most other cardiac murmurs.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Standing causes ↓ preload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **B.** Valsalva (strain) causes ↓ preload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **D.** Nitroglycerin causes ↓ preload/afterload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **E.** Inspiration primarily augments right-sided flow; minimal effect on left-sided HCM murmur.

**Educational objective**

In HCM, maneuvers that increase LV volume (e.g., squatting; ↑ preload/afterload) decrease murmur intensity, whereas maneuvers that decrease LV volume (standing, Valsalva, nitrates) increase it.

**Rapid review**

- HCM = "rebel murmur" (behaves opposite to most)
- Make LV big → murmur quiet
- ↑ LV volume: squat, handgrip, leg raise → softer
- ↓ LV volume: stand, Valsalva, nitrates → louder
- Contrast with AS, MR, VSD (all get softer with ↓ preload)

## Question 20: VSD - Handgrip Effect

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Ventricular Septal Defect (Murmur Physiology)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 9-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic for a routine sports physical. He has no medical complaints. On cardiac examination, a harsh holosystolic murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border and is palpable as a thrill. The murmur becomes louder with sustained handgrip exercise and softer when the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver. Lung fields are clear.

**Question**

Which of the following is the most likely cardiac lesion in this patient?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Aortic stenosis
- ⬜ **B.** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- ✅ **C.** Small ventricular septal defect
- ⬜ **D.** Mitral valve prolapse
- ⬜ **E.** Pulmonary stenosis

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

The combination of a harsh holosystolic murmur at LLSB with palpable thrill and louder with handgrip strongly suggests VSD. Handgrip physiology: ↑ systemic vascular resistance (afterload) → ↑ left-ventricular and aortic pressures → ↑ L→R pressure gradient across VSD → murmur louder. Valsalva (strain): ↓ preload → ↓ LV volume → ↓ shunt flow → murmur softer. Small (restrictive) VSDs produce loud, harsh murmurs with thrill, large L→R gradient (high velocity), and are usually asymptomatic ("Maladie de Roger"). Large (nonrestrictive) VSDs produce softer murmurs (equalized pressures) but cause heart failure symptoms.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Aortic stenosis produces crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur at RUSB, radiates to carotids; decreases with handgrip.
- **B.** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy produces midsystolic murmur that decreases with handgrip and increases with standing/Valsalva.
- **D.** Mitral valve prolapse produces late systolic murmur with click that moves earlier when LV volume falls (standing/Valsalva).
- **E.** Pulmonary stenosis produces systolic ejection murmur at LUSB that increases with inspiration, not handgrip.

**Educational objective**

Handgrip exercise increases afterload, intensifying murmurs of left-to-right shunts (VSD) and regurgitant lesions (MR, AR), while reducing the intensity of outflow-tract murmurs (AS, HCM). Small VSDs are typically loud and asymptomatic; large VSDs produce heart-failure findings and a softer murmur.

**Rapid review**

- Handgrip: ↑ afterload → louder VSD, MR, AR
- Handgrip: ↓ HCM, AS
- Small VSD: loud murmur, asymptomatic
- Large VSD: soft murmur, CHF
- Most VSDs close spontaneously

## Question 21: Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension - Differential Cyanosis

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** PPHN (Right-to-Left Ductal Shunt)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn develops cyanosis several hours after birth. The infant was delivered via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. While changing the diaper, the father notices the legs appear bluish, but the hands and face are pink. Pulse oximetry results: Right hand (preductal): 98%, Left foot (postductal): 83%. The infant exhibits grunting respirations and subcostal retractions. Cardiac auscultation reveals a soft holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Femoral pulses are strong and symmetric.

**Question**

Which of the following best explains this patient's cyanosis?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease after birth, leading to right-to-left flow through the ductus arteriosus
- ⬜ **B.** Increased left atrial pressure causing right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale
- ⬜ **C.** Obstruction of blood flow distal to the left subclavian artery reducing lower-extremity oxygenation
- ⬜ **D.** Increased left-to-right shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus, leading to pulmonary overcirculation
- ⬜ **E.** Reduced systemic vascular resistance causing reversal of flow through an atrial communication

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

This infant has differential cyanosis (pink upper body, blue lower body) indicating right-to-left shunting across the PDA, distal to the left subclavian artery. Normal transition: Birth → ↑ O₂ → pulmonary vasodilation → PVR ↓, PVR < SVR → L→R ductal flow → closure. PPHN (Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of Newborn): PVR remains elevated, PA pressure > aortic pressure, R→L shunt through PDA, deoxygenated blood enters descending aorta, lower-extremity cyanosis. Key findings: Differential cyanosis (hands pink, feet blue), Preductal > Postductal SaO₂ (>5-10% difference), Strong femoral pulses (excludes coarctation), Holosystolic murmur = tricuspid regurgitation (from pulmonary HTN).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** ↑ LA pressure → R→L PFO would be an intracardiac shunt that would desaturate both upper and lower body (no differential).
- **C.** Coarctation would cause weak femorals, not strong ones.
- **D.** L→R PDA shunt causes pulmonary overcirculation, not cyanosis.
- **E.** Low SVR → R→L atrial shunt would cause equal cyanosis in all extremities.

**Educational objective**

Differential cyanosis (pink hands, blue feet) indicates right-to-left flow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery with mixing across a PDA—a classic finding in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease after birth causes right-to-left shunting across the patent ductus arteriosus and produces differential cyanosis.

**Rapid review**

- Differential cyanosis = R→L PDA shunt (PPHN)
- Preductal > postductal SaO₂
- Strong femorals (vs. coarctation)
- Treatment: 100% O₂, inhaled NO, ECMO if refractory
- Reversed differential (blue hands, pink feet) = TGA + PDA

## Question 22: Oxygen Saturation Step-Up - ASD

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Atrial Septal Defect (Cardiac Catheterization)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

Cardiac catheterization is performed on a school-age child for evaluation of a murmur. Oxygen saturations are: SVC 70%, IVC 70%, RA 81%, RV 81%, PA 81%, LA 96%, LV 96%, Aorta 96%.

**Question**

Which of the following findings is most likely on physical examination?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Continuous, machinery-like murmur at the left infraclavicular area
- ✅ **B.** Fixed splitting of S2
- ⬜ **C.** Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
- ⬜ **D.** Bifid carotid pulse with brisk upstroke
- ⬜ **E.** Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

Oxygen saturation step-up analysis: Step-up first appears in RA (70% → 81%), RA, RV, and PA all similarly elevated (81%), Pattern = left-to-right shunt at atrial level (ASD). ASD physiology: L→R shunt → ↑ RA/RV volume, ↑ flow across pulmonic valve, Persistent delay in P2 closure, Fixed wide split S2 (pathognomonic). Why "fixed"? RA pressure equalized with LA throughout respiratory cycle, RV volume overload constant, P2 delay does not vary with respiration.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Continuous murmur indicates PDA (step-up at PA level, not RA).
- **C.** Holosystolic murmur LLSB indicates VSD (step-up at RV level, not RA).
- **D.** Bifid carotid pulse indicates HCM or AR; not a shunt lesion.
- **E.** Early diastolic murmur indicates aortic or pulmonary regurgitation; not a shunt.

**Educational objective**

A step-up in O₂ saturation from SVC/IVC to RA localizes a left-to-right shunt to the atrial level (ASD) and classically causes wide, fixed S2 splitting.

**Rapid review**

- Step-up location determines shunt level: RA = ASD, RV = VSD, PA = PDA
- Fixed split S2 = pathognomonic for ASD
- Flow murmur at LUSB (pulmonic valve)
- May have mid-diastolic rumble (tricuspid flow)

## Question 23: Coarctation of the Aorta - Classic Presentation

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Coarctation of Aorta (Adolescent Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 16-year-old boy is referred to cardiology after a school sports physical reveals elevated blood pressure. He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or syncope and is an active soccer player. Vital signs show blood pressure of 158/88 mm Hg in the right arm and 102/70 mm Hg in the right leg. Physical examination reveals well-developed upper body musculature with relatively smaller lower extremities. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border and between the scapulae posteriorly. Femoral pulses are weak and delayed compared with the brachial pulses. Chest radiograph shows rib notching.

**Question**

Which of the following embryologic abnormalities best explains this patient's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth
- ✅ **B.** Abnormal development of left fourth aortic arch and left dorsal aorta
- ⬜ **C.** Anterior malalignment of the infundibular septum
- ⬜ **D.** Failure of neural crest cell migration affecting the aorticopulmonary septum
- ⬜ **E.** Excessive resorption of septum primum during atrial septation

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This patient has coarctation of the aorta, indicated by: Upper extremity hypertension with lower extremity hypotension, arm-leg blood pressure differential (>20 mm Hg), weak, delayed femoral pulses (brachial-femoral delay), systolic murmur in back (turbulent flow through narrowed aorta), rib notching on CXR (from collateral circulation via intercostal arteries). Coarctation is a discrete narrowing of the aorta, typically just distal to the left subclavian artery at the site of the ligamentum arteriosum (postductal type in adolescents/adults). Embryology: develops from the left fourth aortic arch and left dorsal aorta; abnormal development → localized narrowing; most common site: juxtaductal (near ligamentum arteriosum).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** PDA failure to close creates continuous murmur, wide pulse pressure, bounding pulses (not weak femorals); no arm-leg BP differential.
- **C.** Anterior malalignment of infundibular septum causes Tetralogy of Fallot, not aortic narrowing.
- **D.** Neural crest failure (AP septum) causes truncus arteriosus or TGA, not isolated aortic narrowing.
- **E.** Septum primum resorption causes ASD (ostium secundum), not aortic coarctation.

**Educational objective**

Coarctation of the aorta results from abnormal development of the aortic arch (left fourth arch and dorsal aorta), causing discrete narrowing typically distal to the left subclavian artery. Classic findings include upper extremity hypertension, weak delayed femoral pulses, arm-leg BP differential, and rib notching from collateral flow through intercostal arteries.

**Rapid review**

- Location: Just distal to left subclavian (juxtaductal)
- Classic triad: ↑ upper extremity BP, ↓ lower extremity BP, weak delayed femorals
- CXR findings: "3 sign" (indentation), rib notching (>5 years old)
- Associations: Turner syndrome (15%), bicuspid aortic valve (50-85%), berry aneurysms
- Complications: LV hypertrophy, CHF, aortic rupture, endocarditis, stroke
- Treatment: Surgical repair or balloon angioplasty

## Question 24: Coarctation - Infantile Presentation

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Coarctation of Aorta (Preductal Type)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department for poor feeding and lethargy over the past 2 days. He was born at term without complications but has had difficulty gaining weight. Vital signs show temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 180/min, respiratory rate 68/min, and blood pressure 65/40 mm Hg in the right arm. Physical examination reveals a pale, mottled infant in respiratory distress with weak pulses in all four extremities. Liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the costal margin. A gallop rhythm is present but no significant murmur is heard. When prostaglandin E₁ infusion is started, the infant's perfusion dramatically improves and lower extremity pulses become palpable.

**Question**

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the improvement after prostaglandin E₁ administration?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance improving pulmonary blood flow
- ✅ **B.** Restoration of systemic perfusion to the lower body via patent ductus arteriosus
- ⬜ **C.** Increased myocardial contractility improving cardiac output
- ⬜ **D.** Decreased systemic vascular resistance reducing left ventricular afterload
- ⬜ **E.** Closure of left-to-right shunt reducing pulmonary overcirculation

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has severe (critical) coarctation of the aorta presenting as ductal-dependent systemic circulation. Key findings: Acute decompensation at 2-3 weeks (as ductus closes), poor perfusion, weak pulses in all extremities initially, hepatomegaly and gallop (CHF), dramatic improvement with PGE₁. Preductal (infantile) coarctation: Severe narrowing proximal to or at the ductus arteriosus, lower body perfusion depends on PDA, as ductus closes → acute CHF, shock, metabolic acidosis, upper body may also be poorly perfused due to low cardiac output. PGE₁ mechanism: Keeps ductus arteriosus open, blood from pulmonary artery → descending aorta via PDA, restores perfusion distal to coarctation, allows stabilization before surgical repair.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** ↓ PVR improving pulmonary flow — problem is systemic, not pulmonary; pulmonary flow is adequate.
- **C.** Increased contractility — PGE₁ is not an inotrope; improvement is from opening ductus, not cardiac effect.
- **D.** ↓ SVR reducing afterload — PGE₁ primarily affects ductal smooth muscle; SVR changes are minimal and not the primary mechanism.
- **E.** Closure of L→R shunt — PGE₁ opens the ductus, not closes it; there is no L→R shunt to close in coarctation.

**Educational objective**

Critical (severe preductal) coarctation of the aorta presents in the first 2 weeks of life as the ductus arteriosus closes. Lower body perfusion depends on right-to-left flow through the PDA. Prostaglandin E₁ maintains ductal patency, restoring systemic perfusion distal to the obstruction until surgical repair.

**Rapid review**

- Preductal coarctation = ductal-dependent systemic circulation
- Presents when ductus closes (days 7-14)
- Findings: shock, weak pulses (all extremities), CHF, acidosis
- Differential diagnosis: Sepsis, cardiomyopathy, HLHS
- Treatment: PGE₁ → stabilize → surgical repair
- Associated with: Turner syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve
