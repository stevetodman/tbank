## Question 17: Williams Syndrome - 7q11.23 Deletion

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Williams Syndrome (Clinical Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 5-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for evaluation of developmental delay. His parents describe him as "extremely friendly" and talkative, with an unusual affinity for music and strangers. Physical examination shows a small, upturned nose; long philtrum; full lips and cheeks; and a wide mouth ("elfin" facies). He has a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Blood pressure is normal. Serum calcium is mildly elevated.

**Question**

Which of the following chromosomal abnormalities is most likely responsible for this child's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** 5p deletion (Cri-du-chat syndrome)
- ✅ **B.** 7q11.23 microdeletion involving the elastin gene
- ⬜ **C.** 11p15 imprinting defect (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome)
- ⬜ **D.** 15q11-13 paternal deletion (Prader–Willi syndrome)
- ⬜ **E.** 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This child has Williams syndrome, caused by microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23 including the elastin (ELN) gene. Key features include: Cardiac abnormalities (supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis due to loss of elastin → connective tissue abnormality), Facial features ("elfin" facies with broad forehead, short nose, full cheeks/lips, wide mouth), Personality (extremely social, outgoing, "cocktail party personality"; affinity for music), Metabolic findings (hypercalcemia in infancy from ↑ vitamin D sensitivity), and Cognitive features (mild-moderate intellectual disability, but strong expressive language).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** 5p deletion (Cri-du-chat) presents with "cat-like" cry, microcephaly, wide-spaced eyes; different phenotype.
- **C.** 11p15 imprinting (Beckwith-Wiedemann) presents with macroglossia, organomegaly, omphalocele, Wilms tumor risk; not cardiac/facial pattern here.
- **D.** 15q11-13 paternal deletion (Prader–Willi) presents with hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature; different features.
- **E.** 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge) presents with conotruncal heart defects, thymic hypoplasia, hypocalcemia (opposite), cleft palate; not this pattern.

**Educational objective**

Williams syndrome results from a microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23 including the elastin (ELN) gene. Loss of elastin causes supravalvular aortic stenosis. Patients have "elfin" facial features, an outgoing personality, strong verbal skills, and often hypercalcemia.

**Rapid review**

- 7q11.23 deletion (includes ELN gene)
- Supravalvular AS, peripheral PS
- "Elfin" facies + friendly personality
- Hypercalcemia (infancy)
- Strong language, love of music

## Question 18: 22q11 Deletion (DiGeorge) - Truncus Arteriosus

- **Subject:** Genetics
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** DiGeorge Syndrome (Cardiac Manifestations)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A term neonate presents on day 2 of life with cyanosis and poor perfusion. Physical examination shows a single loud S2 and a harsh ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Chest radiograph reveals an absent thymic shadow. Serum calcium is 6.5 mg/dL (low). Echocardiography demonstrates a persistent truncus arteriosus with a VSD.

**Question**

Which of the following genetic conditions best explains these findings?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** 22q11.2 deletion
- ⬜ **B.** Autosomal trisomy
- ⬜ **C.** Fibrillin mutation
- ⬜ **D.** Frataxin mutation
- ⬜ **E.** Hamartin gene mutation
- ⬜ **F.** Sex chromosome monosomy

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

This neonate has 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge), characterized by: Cardiac abnormalities (conotruncal anomalies including truncus arteriosus, TOF, interrupted aortic arch), Thymic aplasia/hypoplasia → T-cell immunodeficiency (absent thymic shadow), Parathyroid aplasia → hypocalcemia, and other features (cleft palate, learning disabilities). The embryologic mechanism involves failed development of 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches (neural crest defect). CATCH-22 mnemonic: Cardiac abnormalities (conotruncal), Abnormal facies, Thymic aplasia, Cleft palate, Hypocalcemia, 22 = chromosome 22.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** Trisomy 21 is strongly linked to AVSD, not truncus arteriosus.
- **C.** Fibrillin (Marfan) causes aortic root disease in adolescents/young adults, not neonatal conotruncal lesions.
- **D.** Frataxin (Friedreich ataxia) causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; neurologic disease appears later.
- **E.** Hamartin (TSC1, tuberous sclerosis) causes rhabdomyomas, seizures, cortical tubers; not conotruncal with thymic/parathyroid aplasia.
- **F.** Turner (45,X) causes coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve; occurs in females.

**Educational objective**

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge) causes conotruncal anomalies (truncus arteriosus, TOF), thymic aplasia (absent thymic shadow), and hypocalcemia from parathyroid aplasia due to failed development of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches.

**Rapid review**

- CATCH-22 mnemonic
- Conotruncal defects (truncus, TOF, IAA)
- Hypocalcemia (parathyroid aplasia)
- Absent thymus → recurrent infections
- Facial: hypertelorism, low-set ears, micrognathia

## Question 19: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy - Murmur Maneuvers

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Physical Examination)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 24-year-old man with exertional dyspnea is diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). On auscultation, a harsh systolic murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border.

**Question**

Which maneuver will decrease the intensity of this murmur?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Sudden standing (from squatting to standing)
- ⬜ **B.** Straining phase of Valsalva maneuver
- ✅ **C.** Squatting from standing position
- ⬜ **D.** Administration of nitroglycerin
- ⬜ **E.** Inspiration

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

HCM murmur physiology: Obstruction varies inversely with LV volume. Smaller LV → more septal–mitral leaflet contact → louder murmur. Larger LV → less contact → softer murmur. Squatting: ↑ preload **and** ↑ afterload → ↑ LV end-diastolic volume → murmur softens. This is the "rebel murmur" that behaves opposite to most other cardiac murmurs.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Standing causes ↓ preload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **B.** Valsalva (strain) causes ↓ preload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **D.** Nitroglycerin causes ↓ preload/afterload → smaller LV → increases murmur.
- **E.** Inspiration primarily augments right-sided flow; minimal effect on left-sided HCM murmur.

**Educational objective**

In HCM, maneuvers that increase LV volume (e.g., squatting; ↑ preload/afterload) decrease murmur intensity, whereas maneuvers that decrease LV volume (standing, Valsalva, nitrates) increase it.

**Rapid review**

- HCM = "rebel murmur" (behaves opposite to most)
- Make LV big → murmur quiet
- ↑ LV volume: squat, handgrip, leg raise → softer
- ↓ LV volume: stand, Valsalva, nitrates → louder
- Contrast with AS, MR, VSD (all get softer with ↓ preload)

## Question 20: VSD - Handgrip Effect

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Ventricular Septal Defect (Murmur Physiology)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 9-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic for a routine sports physical. He has no medical complaints. On cardiac examination, a harsh holosystolic murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border and is palpable as a thrill. The murmur becomes louder with sustained handgrip exercise and softer when the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver. Lung fields are clear.

**Question**

Which of the following is the most likely cardiac lesion in this patient?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Aortic stenosis
- ⬜ **B.** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- ✅ **C.** Small ventricular septal defect
- ⬜ **D.** Mitral valve prolapse
- ⬜ **E.** Pulmonary stenosis

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

The combination of a harsh holosystolic murmur at LLSB with palpable thrill and louder with handgrip strongly suggests VSD. Handgrip physiology: ↑ systemic vascular resistance (afterload) → ↑ left-ventricular and aortic pressures → ↑ L→R pressure gradient across VSD → murmur louder. Valsalva (strain): ↓ preload → ↓ LV volume → ↓ shunt flow → murmur softer. Small (restrictive) VSDs produce loud, harsh murmurs with thrill, large L→R gradient (high velocity), and are usually asymptomatic ("Maladie de Roger"). Large (nonrestrictive) VSDs produce softer murmurs (equalized pressures) but cause heart failure symptoms.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Aortic stenosis produces crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur at RUSB, radiates to carotids; decreases with handgrip.
- **B.** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy produces midsystolic murmur that decreases with handgrip and increases with standing/Valsalva.
- **D.** Mitral valve prolapse produces late systolic murmur with click that moves earlier when LV volume falls (standing/Valsalva).
- **E.** Pulmonary stenosis produces systolic ejection murmur at LUSB that increases with inspiration, not handgrip.

**Educational objective**

Handgrip exercise increases afterload, intensifying murmurs of left-to-right shunts (VSD) and regurgitant lesions (MR, AR), while reducing the intensity of outflow-tract murmurs (AS, HCM). Small VSDs are typically loud and asymptomatic; large VSDs produce heart-failure findings and a softer murmur.

**Rapid review**

- Handgrip: ↑ afterload → louder VSD, MR, AR
- Handgrip: ↓ HCM, AS
- Small VSD: loud murmur, asymptomatic
- Large VSD: soft murmur, CHF
- Most VSDs close spontaneously

## Question 21: Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension - Differential Cyanosis

- **Subject:** Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** PPHN (Right-to-Left Ductal Shunt)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn develops cyanosis several hours after birth. The infant was delivered via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. While changing the diaper, the father notices the legs appear bluish, but the hands and face are pink. Pulse oximetry results: Right hand (preductal): 98%, Left foot (postductal): 83%. The infant exhibits grunting respirations and subcostal retractions. Cardiac auscultation reveals a soft holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. Femoral pulses are strong and symmetric.

**Question**

Which of the following best explains this patient's cyanosis?

**Answer choices**

- ✅ **A.** Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease after birth, leading to right-to-left flow through the ductus arteriosus
- ⬜ **B.** Increased left atrial pressure causing right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale
- ⬜ **C.** Obstruction of blood flow distal to the left subclavian artery reducing lower-extremity oxygenation
- ⬜ **D.** Increased left-to-right shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus, leading to pulmonary overcirculation
- ⬜ **E.** Reduced systemic vascular resistance causing reversal of flow through an atrial communication

**Correct answer:** A

**Explanation**

This infant has differential cyanosis (pink upper body, blue lower body) indicating right-to-left shunting across the PDA, distal to the left subclavian artery. Normal transition: Birth → ↑ O₂ → pulmonary vasodilation → PVR ↓, PVR < SVR → L→R ductal flow → closure. PPHN (Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of Newborn): PVR remains elevated, PA pressure > aortic pressure, R→L shunt through PDA, deoxygenated blood enters descending aorta, lower-extremity cyanosis. Key findings: Differential cyanosis (hands pink, feet blue), Preductal > Postductal SaO₂ (>5-10% difference), Strong femoral pulses (excludes coarctation), Holosystolic murmur = tricuspid regurgitation (from pulmonary HTN).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **B.** ↑ LA pressure → R→L PFO would be an intracardiac shunt that would desaturate both upper and lower body (no differential).
- **C.** Coarctation would cause weak femorals, not strong ones.
- **D.** L→R PDA shunt causes pulmonary overcirculation, not cyanosis.
- **E.** Low SVR → R→L atrial shunt would cause equal cyanosis in all extremities.

**Educational objective**

Differential cyanosis (pink hands, blue feet) indicates right-to-left flow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery with mixing across a PDA—a classic finding in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease after birth causes right-to-left shunting across the patent ductus arteriosus and produces differential cyanosis.

**Rapid review**

- Differential cyanosis = R→L PDA shunt (PPHN)
- Preductal > postductal SaO₂
- Strong femorals (vs. coarctation)
- Treatment: 100% O₂, inhaled NO, ECMO if refractory
- Reversed differential (blue hands, pink feet) = TGA + PDA

## Question 22: Oxygen Saturation Step-Up - ASD

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Atrial Septal Defect (Cardiac Catheterization)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

Cardiac catheterization is performed on a school-age child for evaluation of a murmur. Oxygen saturations are: SVC 70%, IVC 70%, RA 81%, RV 81%, PA 81%, LA 96%, LV 96%, Aorta 96%.

**Question**

Which of the following findings is most likely on physical examination?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Continuous, machinery-like murmur at the left infraclavicular area
- ✅ **B.** Fixed splitting of S2
- ⬜ **C.** Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
- ⬜ **D.** Bifid carotid pulse with brisk upstroke
- ⬜ **E.** Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

Oxygen saturation step-up analysis: Step-up first appears in RA (70% → 81%), RA, RV, and PA all similarly elevated (81%), Pattern = left-to-right shunt at atrial level (ASD). ASD physiology: L→R shunt → ↑ RA/RV volume, ↑ flow across pulmonic valve, Persistent delay in P2 closure, Fixed wide split S2 (pathognomonic). Why "fixed"? RA pressure equalized with LA throughout respiratory cycle, RV volume overload constant, P2 delay does not vary with respiration.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Continuous murmur indicates PDA (step-up at PA level, not RA).
- **C.** Holosystolic murmur LLSB indicates VSD (step-up at RV level, not RA).
- **D.** Bifid carotid pulse indicates HCM or AR; not a shunt lesion.
- **E.** Early diastolic murmur indicates aortic or pulmonary regurgitation; not a shunt.

**Educational objective**

A step-up in O₂ saturation from SVC/IVC to RA localizes a left-to-right shunt to the atrial level (ASD) and classically causes wide, fixed S2 splitting.

**Rapid review**

- Step-up location determines shunt level: RA = ASD, RV = VSD, PA = PDA
- Fixed split S2 = pathognomonic for ASD
- Flow murmur at LUSB (pulmonic valve)
- May have mid-diastolic rumble (tricuspid flow)

## Question 23: Coarctation of the Aorta - Classic Presentation

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Coarctation of Aorta (Adolescent Presentation)
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 16-year-old boy is referred to cardiology after a school sports physical reveals elevated blood pressure. He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or syncope and is an active soccer player. Vital signs show blood pressure of 158/88 mm Hg in the right arm and 102/70 mm Hg in the right leg. Physical examination reveals well-developed upper body musculature with relatively smaller lower extremities. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border and between the scapulae posteriorly. Femoral pulses are weak and delayed compared with the brachial pulses. Chest radiograph shows rib notching.

**Question**

Which of the following embryologic abnormalities best explains this patient's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth
- ✅ **B.** Abnormal development of left fourth aortic arch and left dorsal aorta
- ⬜ **C.** Anterior malalignment of the infundibular septum
- ⬜ **D.** Failure of neural crest cell migration affecting the aorticopulmonary septum
- ⬜ **E.** Excessive resorption of septum primum during atrial septation

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This patient has coarctation of the aorta, indicated by: Upper extremity hypertension with lower extremity hypotension, arm-leg blood pressure differential (>20 mm Hg), weak, delayed femoral pulses (brachial-femoral delay), systolic murmur in back (turbulent flow through narrowed aorta), rib notching on CXR (from collateral circulation via intercostal arteries). Coarctation is a discrete narrowing of the aorta, typically just distal to the left subclavian artery at the site of the ligamentum arteriosum (postductal type in adolescents/adults). Embryology: develops from the left fourth aortic arch and left dorsal aorta; abnormal development → localized narrowing; most common site: juxtaductal (near ligamentum arteriosum).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** PDA failure to close creates continuous murmur, wide pulse pressure, bounding pulses (not weak femorals); no arm-leg BP differential.
- **C.** Anterior malalignment of infundibular septum causes Tetralogy of Fallot, not aortic narrowing.
- **D.** Neural crest failure (AP septum) causes truncus arteriosus or TGA, not isolated aortic narrowing.
- **E.** Septum primum resorption causes ASD (ostium secundum), not aortic coarctation.

**Educational objective**

Coarctation of the aorta results from abnormal development of the aortic arch (left fourth arch and dorsal aorta), causing discrete narrowing typically distal to the left subclavian artery. Classic findings include upper extremity hypertension, weak delayed femoral pulses, arm-leg BP differential, and rib notching from collateral flow through intercostal arteries.

**Rapid review**

- Location: Just distal to left subclavian (juxtaductal)
- Classic triad: ↑ upper extremity BP, ↓ lower extremity BP, weak delayed femorals
- CXR findings: "3 sign" (indentation), rib notching (>5 years old)
- Associations: Turner syndrome (15%), bicuspid aortic valve (50-85%), berry aneurysms
- Complications: LV hypertrophy, CHF, aortic rupture, endocarditis, stroke
- Treatment: Surgical repair or balloon angioplasty

## Question 24: Coarctation - Infantile Presentation

- **Subject:** Cardiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular
- **Topic:** Coarctation of Aorta (Preductal Type)
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department for poor feeding and lethargy over the past 2 days. He was born at term without complications but has had difficulty gaining weight. Vital signs show temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 180/min, respiratory rate 68/min, and blood pressure 65/40 mm Hg in the right arm. Physical examination reveals a pale, mottled infant in respiratory distress with weak pulses in all four extremities. Liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the costal margin. A gallop rhythm is present but no significant murmur is heard. When prostaglandin E₁ infusion is started, the infant's perfusion dramatically improves and lower extremity pulses become palpable.

**Question**

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the improvement after prostaglandin E₁ administration?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance improving pulmonary blood flow
- ✅ **B.** Restoration of systemic perfusion to the lower body via patent ductus arteriosus
- ⬜ **C.** Increased myocardial contractility improving cardiac output
- ⬜ **D.** Decreased systemic vascular resistance reducing left ventricular afterload
- ⬜ **E.** Closure of left-to-right shunt reducing pulmonary overcirculation

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has severe (critical) coarctation of the aorta presenting as ductal-dependent systemic circulation. Key findings: Acute decompensation at 2-3 weeks (as ductus closes), poor perfusion, weak pulses in all extremities initially, hepatomegaly and gallop (CHF), dramatic improvement with PGE₁. Preductal (infantile) coarctation: Severe narrowing proximal to or at the ductus arteriosus, lower body perfusion depends on PDA, as ductus closes → acute CHF, shock, metabolic acidosis, upper body may also be poorly perfused due to low cardiac output. PGE₁ mechanism: Keeps ductus arteriosus open, blood from pulmonary artery → descending aorta via PDA, restores perfusion distal to coarctation, allows stabilization before surgical repair.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** ↓ PVR improving pulmonary flow — problem is systemic, not pulmonary; pulmonary flow is adequate.
- **C.** Increased contractility — PGE₁ is not an inotrope; improvement is from opening ductus, not cardiac effect.
- **D.** ↓ SVR reducing afterload — PGE₁ primarily affects ductal smooth muscle; SVR changes are minimal and not the primary mechanism.
- **E.** Closure of L→R shunt — PGE₁ opens the ductus, not closes it; there is no L→R shunt to close in coarctation.

**Educational objective**

Critical (severe preductal) coarctation of the aorta presents in the first 2 weeks of life as the ductus arteriosus closes. Lower body perfusion depends on right-to-left flow through the PDA. Prostaglandin E₁ maintains ductal patency, restoring systemic perfusion distal to the obstruction until surgical repair.

**Rapid review**

- Preductal coarctation = ductal-dependent systemic circulation
- Presents when ductus closes (days 7-14)
- Findings: shock, weak pulses (all extremities), CHF, acidosis
- Differential diagnosis: Sepsis, cardiomyopathy, HLHS
- Treatment: PGE₁ → stabilize → surgical repair
- Associated with: Turner syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve

## Question 25: Eisenmenger Syndrome - Pathophysiology

- **Subject:** Pathophysiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Eisenmenger Syndrome
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 28-year-old woman presents to the cardiology clinic with progressive dyspnea and fatigue over the past year. She was diagnosed with a large ventricular septal defect in childhood but her family could not afford surgery. Physical examination reveals central cyanosis, digital clubbing, and a prominent right ventricular heave. A loud P2 is heard, but the previously documented holosystolic murmur is no longer present. Chest radiograph shows enlarged central pulmonary arteries with peripheral pruning. Echocardiography demonstrates severe pulmonary hypertension with bidirectional shunting across the VSD.

**Question**

Which of the following pathophysiologic processes best explains the change in this patient's murmur?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Spontaneous closure of the ventricular septal defect
- ⬜ **B.** Development of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction
- ✅ **C.** Reversal of shunt direction due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance
- ⬜ **D.** Progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction
- ⬜ **E.** Development of tricuspid regurgitation masking the VSD murmur

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

This patient has Eisenmenger syndrome, the irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension that develops from long-standing left-to-right shunts. Initially, the large VSD caused a left-to-right shunt with high pulmonary blood flow, producing a holosystolic murmur. Years of excessive pulmonary flow caused progressive pulmonary vascular remodeling with medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, and ultimately plexiform lesions. As pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increases and eventually exceeds systemic vascular resistance (SVR), the shunt reverses to right-to-left. With equalized pressures across the VSD, there is no longer a pressure gradient to produce a murmur—hence the disappearance of the holosystolic murmur. The loud P2 reflects pulmonary hypertension. Central cyanosis and clubbing result from deoxygenated blood bypassing the lungs via the right-to-left shunt. This condition is inoperable because the pulmonary vascular disease is fixed.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Spontaneous VSD closure – While small VSDs can close spontaneously, large VSDs (which cause Eisenmenger syndrome) rarely close. Moreover, if the VSD closed, the patient would not have bidirectional shunting on echo and would likely have worsening right heart failure from pure pulmonary hypertension without a pop-off mechanism.
- **B.** RVOT obstruction – This would create a new murmur (systolic ejection murmur), not eliminate the existing VSD murmur. RVOT obstruction is characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot, not Eisenmenger syndrome.
- **D.** LV dysfunction – Would cause symptoms of heart failure but wouldn't eliminate the VSD murmur. In fact, LV dysfunction might reduce shunt volume but a pressure gradient would still exist if the shunt were left-to-right.
- **E.** TR masking VSD murmur – Tricuspid regurgitation does commonly develop with pulmonary hypertension, but it creates its own holosystolic murmur (different location and characteristics), rather than masking the VSD murmur.

**Educational objective**

Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when long-standing left-to-right shunts cause irreversible pulmonary vascular disease. As pulmonary vascular resistance exceeds systemic resistance, the shunt reverses to right-to-left. The previously audible murmur disappears as pressures equalize across the defect, and patients develop cyanosis and clubbing from chronic hypoxemia.

**Rapid review**

- Eisenmenger = irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension from chronic L→R shunt
- PVR remodeling (medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, plexiform lesions)
- PVR > SVR → shunt reversal (R→L)
- Murmur disappears when pressures equalize
- Exam: Cyanosis, clubbing, loud P2, hemoptysis risk
- Management: Supportive care, pulmonary vasodilators, transplant consideration

## Question 26: Complete AVSD - Down Syndrome Association

- **Subject:** Genetics/Pathology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Atrioventricular Septal Defect
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 2-month-old infant with trisomy 21 is brought to the pediatrician for poor feeding and tachypnea. The parents report the infant sweats profusely during feeds and takes frequent breaks. Physical examination reveals tachypnea, a hyperdynamic precordium, and a holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border with radiation to the axilla. The liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. Chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiography demonstrates a large primum atrial septal defect, inlet ventricular septal defect, and a common atrioventricular valve.

**Question**

Which of the following embryologic abnormalities best explains this infant's cardiac defect?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Failure of neural crest cell migration
- ✅ **B.** Incomplete fusion of endocardial cushions
- ⬜ **C.** Abnormal septation of the truncus arteriosus
- ⬜ **D.** Premature closure of the foramen ovale
- ⬜ **E.** Persistence of the ostium secundum

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), also called endocardial cushion defect or atrioventricular canal defect, which is the most common cardiac anomaly in Down syndrome (40-45% of cardiac defects in trisomy 21). Complete AVSD results from failure of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions to fuse during weeks 4-5 of embryonic development. These cushions normally fuse to form the lower portion of the atrial septum (septum primum), the upper portion of the ventricular septum, and separate the mitral and tricuspid valves. When fusion fails, the result is: (1) primum ASD, (2) inlet VSD, and (3) a common AV valve with a characteristic “cleft” in the anterior mitral leaflet. The large left-to-right shunt causes excessive pulmonary blood flow, leading to congestive heart failure (tachypnea, hepatomegaly, poor feeding). The holosystolic murmur represents either the VSD or AV valve regurgitation (or both).

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Neural crest cell failure – Neural crest cells contribute to conotruncal development and aortic arch formation. Defects in neural crest migration cause conotruncal abnormalities (truncus arteriosus, transposition, tetralogy of Fallot) and aortic arch anomalies (interrupted aortic arch, coarctation). Neural crest cells are not involved in endocardial cushion or AV valve formation.
- **C.** Truncus septation abnormality – Abnormal septation of the truncus arteriosus produces conotruncal defects such as persistent truncus arteriosus, transposition of great arteries, or tetralogy of Fallot. These are characterized by abnormal great vessel relationships, not AV valve or septal defects at the crux of the heart.
- **D.** Premature foramen ovale closure – The foramen ovale normally remains patent throughout fetal life and closes functionally at birth (and anatomically over months to years). Premature closure would cause fetal hydrops and stillbirth, not the cardiac anatomy seen here. This doesn't create AVSDs.
- **E.** Persistent ostium secundum – Persistent ostium secundum creates a secundum ASD, not the primum ASD seen in AVSD. Secundum ASDs result from excessive resorption of septum primum or inadequate growth of septum secundum, completely separate from endocardial cushion development. Secundum ASDs don't involve the AV valves or ventricular septum.

**Educational objective**

Complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) results from failure of endocardial cushion fusion, creating a primum ASD, inlet VSD, and common AV valve. AVSD is the most common cardiac defect in Down syndrome and presents with congestive heart failure from excessive pulmonary blood flow.

**Rapid review**

- AVSD = endocardial cushion defect
- Trisomy 21 association (40-45%)
- Anatomy: Primum ASD + inlet VSD + common AV valve
- Physiology: Large L→R shunt → CHF, pulmonary overcirculation
- Early surgical repair (3-6 months) prevents Eisenmenger progression

## Question 27: Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return - Obstructed

- **Subject:** Pathology/Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn develops severe respiratory distress and cyanosis within hours of birth. The infant is lethargic with poor perfusion. Physical examination reveals tachypnea, grunting, retractions, and central cyanosis. Oxygen saturation is 65% despite 100% inspired oxygen. A loud single S2 is heard, but no murmur is audible. The liver is not enlarged. Chest radiograph shows a normal-sized heart with diffuse ground-glass opacities and prominent interstitial markings. Initial assessment suggests severe persistent pulmonary hypertension, but echocardiography reveals all four pulmonary veins draining into a vertical vein posterior to the left atrium, which descends and enters a hepatic vein below the diaphragm.

**Question**

Which of the following best explains this infant's severe presentation in the first hours of life?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Mixing at the atrial level through a restrictive foramen ovale
- ✅ **B.** Pulmonary venous obstruction from compression of the vertical vein
- ⬜ **C.** Decreased pulmonary blood flow from right ventricular hypoplasia
- ⬜ **D.** Severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
- ⬜ **E.** Parallel circulation with inadequate ductal mixing

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has infracardiac (type 3) total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) with obstruction—the most critical variant requiring emergency surgery. In TAPVR, all four pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium and instead drain anomalously into the systemic venous system. In the infracardiac type, a vertical vein descends through the diaphragm to join the portal venous system or ductus venosus. This pathway is inherently restrictive because (1) the vertical vein traverses the diaphragm and can be compressed during breathing, (2) the hepatic sinusoids offer high resistance, and (3) mixing with deoxygenated blood occurs before reaching the heart. Obstruction causes severe pulmonary venous congestion with pulmonary edema (ground-glass appearance on CXR), pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The infant presents with severe cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen because blood cannot adequately return from the lungs. The normal heart size distinguishes this from typical congestive heart failure (which causes cardiomegaly). This is a surgical emergency—delayed diagnosis is fatal.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Restrictive foramen ovale – TAPVR requires an ASD for survival, but a restrictive foramen ovale would cause right heart failure and cyanosis without the diffuse pulmonary edema seen here. The severity and immediate presentation point to venous obstruction rather than inadequate atrial mixing.
- **C.** RV hypoplasia – The right ventricle receives increased preload in TAPVR (all pulmonary and systemic venous return), leading to dilation, not hypoplasia. The clinical picture stems from venous obstruction, not insufficient RV output.
- **D.** LVOT obstruction – TAPVR does not involve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The left ventricle is typically small due to reduced preload, but that does not explain the pulmonary edema pattern.
- **E.** Parallel circulation – Refers to transposition of the great arteries, which presents with cyanosis but typically not with pulmonary edema or respiratory failure, and has a different chest radiograph appearance (egg-on-a-string silhouette).

**Educational objective**

Obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return (especially infracardiac type) presents in the first hours of life with severe cyanosis and respiratory distress from pulmonary venous congestion. The chest radiograph shows pulmonary edema with a normal-sized heart, mimicking severe lung disease. This is a surgical emergency.

**Rapid review**

- TAPVR = pulmonary veins drain to systemic venous circulation
- Infracardiac type prone to obstruction (ductal/portal course)
- Obstruction → pulmonary edema + pulmonary hypertension
- Cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen (mixing limited)
- Requires urgent surgery after stabilization

## Question 28: Truncus Arteriosus - Presentation

- **Subject:** Pathology/Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Truncus Arteriosus
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 3-week-old infant is brought to the pediatrician for poor feeding and rapid breathing. The infant was born at term without complications. Over the past week, the parents have noticed increasing difficulty with feeding, with the infant becoming tired and sweaty during feeds. Physical examination reveals tachypnea, a hyperdynamic precordium, and a harsh systolic murmur heard at the left sternal border. A loud single S2 is noted. The infant has mild cyanosis of the lips. Chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiography demonstrates a single large arterial trunk arising from the heart, giving rise to the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and coronary arteries, with a large ventricular septal defect directly beneath the truncal valve.

**Question**

Which of the following hemodynamic abnormalities best explains this infant's clinical presentation?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Decreased pulmonary blood flow from severe pulmonary stenosis
- ⬜ **B.** Parallel circulations with minimal mixing
- ✅ **C.** Excessive pulmonary blood flow from low pulmonary vascular resistance
- ⬜ **D.** Complete mixing with balanced systemic and pulmonary blood flow
- ⬜ **E.** Pulmonary venous obstruction with pulmonary edema

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

This infant has persistent truncus arteriosus, a conotruncal defect where failure of the truncus arteriosus to divide results in a single great vessel supplying the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. The truncal valve overrides a large VSD, and the pulmonary arteries arise directly from the common trunk. The hemodynamic consequence is torrential pulmonary blood flow because (1) the pulmonary arteries receive blood directly from the high-pressure truncus, (2) as pulmonary vascular resistance drops after birth, pulmonary flow increases dramatically, and (3) complete mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs in the trunk. The result is pulmonary overcirculation with congestive heart failure plus mild cyanosis from mixing. The single loud S2 reflects the single truncal valve. Without early surgery, irreversible pulmonary vascular disease and Eisenmenger physiology develop rapidly.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Decreased pulmonary flow – Truncus arteriosus causes increased, not decreased, pulmonary flow.
- **B.** Parallel circulations – Describes transposition of the great arteries; truncus has a single common outflow.
- **D.** Balanced mixing – Flow is not balanced because low pulmonary resistance favors pulmonary over systemic flow.
- **E.** Pulmonary venous obstruction – Occurs in lesions like obstructed TAPVR, not truncus arteriosus where venous return is normal.

**Educational objective**

Persistent truncus arteriosus results in torrential pulmonary blood flow once pulmonary vascular resistance falls, leading to congestive heart failure with mild cyanosis. Early surgical repair is required to prevent irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.

**Rapid review**

- Single arterial trunk supplies systemic + pulmonary circulations
- Large VSD with obligatory mixing
- Low PVR → pulmonary overcirculation → CHF
- Single S2 (single truncal valve)
- Repair in infancy (VSD closure + RV-PA conduit)

## Question 29: Tricuspid Atresia - Pathophysiology

- **Subject:** Pathology/Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Tricuspid Atresia
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn develops progressive cyanosis over the first 24 hours of life. The infant appears comfortable at rest but becomes more cyanotic with crying. Physical examination reveals central cyanosis, tachypnea, and a single S2. A soft systolic murmur is heard at the left sternal border, but no diastolic murmur is present. Oxygen saturation is 70% and does not improve significantly with supplemental oxygen. Chest radiograph shows decreased pulmonary vascular markings and a boot-shaped cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography demonstrates absence of the tricuspid valve with no flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle, along with an atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect.

**Question**

Which of the following pathways is essential for this infant's survival?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Right-to-left shunting at the atrial level
- ⬜ **B.** Patent ductus arteriosus providing pulmonary blood flow
- ✅ **C.** Left-to-right shunting through the ventricular septal defect
- ⬜ **D.** Anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right atrium
- ⬜ **E.** Coronary arterial fistula to the right ventricle

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation**

This infant has tricuspid atresia, characterized by complete absence of the tricuspid valve and no connection between the right atrium and right ventricle. For survival, systemic venous blood must cross an ASD to reach the left atrium and left ventricle, where it mixes with pulmonary venous return. From the left ventricle, blood must reach the pulmonary circulation via a left-to-right shunt across a VSD into the hypoplastic right ventricle and then into the pulmonary artery. The VSD is the critical route for pulmonary blood flow; without it, no blood reaches the lungs. A PDA may supplement flow if the VSD is restrictive, but the VSD pathway is essential.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Atrial right-to-left shunting is necessary for survival but does not on its own provide pulmonary blood flow. Without a VSD, blood would never reach the pulmonary artery.
- **B.** A PDA can augment pulmonary flow when the VSD is small, but most patients rely primarily on the VSD route.
- **D.** Pulmonary venous drainage is normal in tricuspid atresia; anomalous return is a different lesion.
- **E.** Coronary fistulas are not part of tricuspid atresia anatomy and would not sustain pulmonary circulation.

**Educational objective**

Tricuspid atresia requires obligatory atrial mixing (right-to-left shunt) and left-to-right shunting across a ventricular septal defect to deliver blood to the pulmonary circulation. Adequate communication at both the atrial and ventricular levels is crucial for survival.

**Rapid review**

- Absent tricuspid valve → no RA→RV connection
- ASD: systemic venous blood → LA/LV
- VSD: LV → hypoplastic RV → pulmonary artery (essential pathway)
- Cyanosis severity depends on VSD size ± PDA
- Staged single-ventricle palliation (BT shunt/ductal stent → Glenn → Fontan)

## Question 30: Ebstein Anomaly - Tricuspid Valve Malformation

- **Subject:** Pathology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Ebstein Anomaly
- **Difficulty:** Medium (★2/5)
- **Estimated time:** 90 seconds

**Vignette**

A 16-year-old girl presents to the cardiology clinic for evaluation of exercise intolerance and palpitations. She reports becoming short of breath with mild exertion and occasionally feels her heart racing. She has a history of “a heart murmur” since infancy but has not had regular cardiology follow-up. Physical examination reveals mild cyanosis of the lips and a prominent jugular venous pulsation with a prominent V wave. Cardiac auscultation reveals a widely split S1 with a soft, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border that increases with inspiration. Chest radiograph shows massive cardiomegaly with a “box-shaped” heart. Electrocardiogram demonstrates a right bundle branch block pattern and tall, peaked P waves in lead II.

**Question**

Echocardiography in this patient would most likely show which of the following findings?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Anterior displacement of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve
- ✅ **B.** Apical displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve
- ⬜ **C.** Bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps
- ⬜ **D.** Myxomatous degeneration with prolapse of the anterior mitral leaflet
- ⬜ **E.** Thickening and fusion of the tricuspid valve leaflets with doming during diastole

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This patient has Ebstein anomaly, a congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve characterized by apical displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets into the right ventricle. The anterior leaflet is elongated and “sail-like,” creating an atrialized portion of the right ventricle and a massively enlarged right atrium. Consequences include severe tricuspid regurgitation (holosystolic murmur increasing with inspiration), reduced functional RV size, cyanosis from right-to-left atrial shunting, and a wide spectrum of arrhythmias (often Wolff-Parkinson-White). The widely split S1 is classic, reflecting delayed tricuspid closure.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Describes mitral valve prolapse, which causes a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur rather than a holosystolic, inspiration-increased murmur.
- **C.** Bicuspid aortic valve produces an ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border and does not explain cyanosis or massive right atrial enlargement.
- **D.** Myxomatous mitral valve prolapse results in a murmur radiating to the axilla and lacks the right-sided findings present here.
- **E.** Thickened, doming tricuspid leaflets suggest rheumatic tricuspid stenosis, a rare condition presenting with a diastolic rumble, not the holosystolic regurgitant murmur heard in Ebstein anomaly.

**Educational objective**

Ebstein anomaly features apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets with an atrialized right ventricle, massive right atrial enlargement, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. A widely split S1 and association with Wolff-Parkinson-White are characteristic.

**Rapid review**

- Apical displacement of septal/posterior tricuspid leaflets
- Atrialized RV + massive RA (“box-shaped” heart)
- Severe TR → holosystolic murmur ↑ with inspiration
- Widely split S1 (pathognomonic)

## Question 31: ALCAPA - Coronary Artery Anomaly

- **Subject:** Pathology/Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from Pulmonary Artery
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A 4-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department for irritability during feeding and profuse sweating. The parents report the infant has been less active over the past month and occasionally appears uncomfortable, drawing up the legs and crying inconsolably for 10-15 minutes. Physical examination reveals a pale, diaphoretic infant with tachypnea and tachycardia. The infant appears fatigued. A soft systolic murmur is heard at the apex with radiation to the axilla. The liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. Electrocardiogram shows deep Q waves in leads I and aVL with ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in the lateral leads. Chest radiograph reveals cardiomegaly. Echocardiography demonstrates severe left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and bright echogenic areas in the anterolateral left ventricular wall.

**Question**

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's condition?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Viral myocarditis causing diffuse ventricular dysfunction
- ✅ **B.** Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery
- ⬜ **C.** Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
- ⬜ **D.** Critical aortic stenosis with endocardial fibroelastosis
- ⬜ **E.** Kawasaki disease with coronary artery aneurysms

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome. In utero and immediately after birth, high pulmonary artery pressures supply adequate flow to the left coronary artery. As pulmonary vascular resistance drops over the first weeks of life, pulmonary artery pressure falls, leading to decreased perfusion of the left coronary system and reversal of flow from the right to left coronary circulation into the pulmonary artery (coronary steal). Chronic myocardial ischemia produces anterolateral infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, papillary muscle insufficiency with mitral regurgitation, and congestive heart failure. Infants present with angina equivalents—irritability, diaphoresis, and crying with feeds. ECG findings of deep Q waves in leads I and aVL and echogenic anterolateral myocardium on echo confirm infarction. Surgical reimplantation of the LCA into the aorta is required.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Viral myocarditis causes diffuse ventricular dysfunction following a viral prodrome and lacks the regional ischemic pattern seen here.
- **C.** Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy produces global dilation and hypokinesis without localized infarction or Q waves.
- **D.** Critical aortic stenosis presents in the neonatal period with shock and concentric hypertrophy, not regional infarction.
- **E.** Kawasaki disease requires prolonged fever with mucocutaneous findings and typically affects older infants/toddlers.

**Educational objective**

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery causes myocardial ischemia once pulmonary vascular resistance falls, leading to infarction, severe LV dysfunction, and mitral regurgitation. Prompt surgical correction is lifesaving.

**Rapid review**

- Left coronary arises from pulmonary artery (not aorta)
- As PVR drops → coronary steal (RCA → LCA → PA)
- Angina equivalent in infants: irritability, diaphoresis with feeds
- ECG: Deep Q waves I, aVL; lateral ST/T changes
- Echo: Anterolateral wall brightening, severe LV dysfunction, MR
- Treatment: Surgical reimplantation of LCA into aorta

## Question 32: Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome - Ductal-Dependent Systemic Circulation

- **Subject:** Pathology/Physiology
- **System:** Cardiovascular System
- **Topic:** Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
- **Difficulty:** Hard (★3/5)
- **Estimated time:** 120 seconds

**Vignette**

A term newborn appears well immediately after birth but develops progressive lethargy, poor feeding, and mottled skin over the first 24 hours of life. By 36 hours, the infant is in extremis with profound metabolic acidosis, absent femoral pulses, and severe hypotension. Physical examination reveals a gray, cool infant with weak central pulses and absent peripheral pulses. A single loud S2 is heard without murmurs. Oxygen saturation is 85% in the right hand and 88% in the feet. Chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. Echocardiography demonstrates severe hypoplasia of the left ventricle, mitral valve, and ascending aorta with aortic valve atresia. The patent ductus arteriosus is closing.

**Question**

Which of the following interventions would most likely stabilize this infant pending definitive surgical management?

**Answer choices**

- ⬜ **A.** Immediate atrial septostomy to improve mixing
- ✅ **B.** Prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductal patency
- ⬜ **C.** Supplemental oxygen to improve systemic oxygen delivery
- ⬜ **D.** Inotropic support with dopamine and milrinone
- ⬜ **E.** Emergent surgical closure of the patent ductus arteriosus

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation**

This infant has hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), the most severe left-sided obstructive lesion. Systemic perfusion is entirely dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus because the diminutive left ventricle and ascending aorta cannot support systemic output. The right ventricle supplies both pulmonary and systemic circulations, sending blood through the pulmonary artery; systemic perfusion occurs via retrograde flow across the ductus into the descending aorta and coronary arteries. As the ductus closes after birth, systemic perfusion collapses, producing shock and metabolic acidosis. Immediate prostaglandin E1 infusion reopens/maintains the ductus, restoring systemic output and buying time for staged surgical palliation or transplant. Excess oxygen is avoided because it reduces pulmonary vascular resistance, stealing flow from the systemic circulation.

**Why the other answers fall short**

- **A.** Atrial septostomy improves mixing when the atrial communication is restrictive but does not restore systemic output if the ductus is closing.
- **C.** Supplemental oxygen lowers pulmonary vascular resistance and diverts more blood to the lungs, worsening systemic perfusion in HLHS.
- **D.** Inotropes cannot overcome the anatomic absence of a functional systemic ventricle; ductal patency is the critical step.
- **E.** Ductal closure would be fatal because the PDA is the only route for systemic flow.

**Educational objective**

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a ductal-dependent systemic circulation. Maintaining ductal patency with prostaglandin E1 is lifesaving, whereas excessive oxygen can worsen systemic perfusion. Definitive management requires staged surgical palliation or transplant.

**Rapid review**

- Hypoplastic LV/mitral/aortic structures + aortic atresia
- Systemic output entirely via PDA (RV → PA → PDA → systemic)
- Ductal closure → shock, acidosis, absent pulses
- Management: PGE1, limit FiO2 (~21%), balance Qp:Qs
- Definitive therapy: Norwood → Glenn → Fontan or transplant
